## Program 1
* [freefall.py](./freefall.py):
The user will enter the height from which the object is dropped in meters(m). Because the object is dropped its initial speed is 0m/s. Assuming the acceleration due to gravity is 9.8 metres per second square. The formula vf = sqrt(v2 i + 2ad) is used to compute the final speed, vf.

## Program 2
* [ideal_gas.py](./ideal_gas.py):
computes the amount of gas in moles when the user supplies the pressure, volume and temperature.
